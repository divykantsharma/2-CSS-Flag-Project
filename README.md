Made this project and learned about internal CSS and how to combine CSS selectors.

-> Creating a CSS flag project can be a fun and creative way to practice your CSS skills. It involves designing and coding a flag using HTML and CSS. Here's a general overview of how you can approach a CSS flag project:
1. Planning: Start by selecting a flag that you want to recreate using CSS. Research the flag's design, colors, and any specific elements or patterns it may have. Consider the complexity of the flag design and choose one that suits your skill level and time constraints.
2. HTML Structure: Create the basic HTML structure for your flag project. Typically, this involves using div elements and possibly nested elements to represent different parts of the flag, such as the background, stripes, or emblem.
3. CSS Styling: Use CSS to style and position the elements to recreate the flag design. Here are some key aspects to consider:
4. Colors: Use the appropriate colors for each part of the flag. You can specify colors using CSS color codes or names.
5. Stripes or Patterns: If the flag has stripes or intricate patterns, you can use CSS techniques like gradients, linear or radial backgrounds, or repeating patterns to achieve the desired look.
6. Positioning and Sizing: Use CSS positioning and sizing properties like width, height, margin, padding, and position to arrange and align the elements properly.
7. Typography: If the flag includes text or numbers, use CSS to style the typography, such as setting the font family, size, weight, and alignment.
8. Testing and Optimization: Test your CSS flag project on different web browsers and devices to ensure consistent rendering. Optimize your CSS code by removing any unnecessary or redundant styles.
